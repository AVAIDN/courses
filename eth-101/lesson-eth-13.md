# Project 3: Final Project

Great job making the final project. To recap we've built our very own meme coin, crypto bank, and deployed smart contracts but before you can official be a Cadena graduate and earn your NFT certificate, there's one more project.

For your final project, you can create a DAPP of your choice.

 The project must includes the following:

1. Create a smart contract. You're welcome to use [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)'s libaries.
2. Getters that read from your contact and setters that write to your smart contract.
3. Incorporate the ability for at least 2 types of transactions of your choice ex. send tokens, make a deposit, etc.
4. Create front-end for your DAPP using Ethers.js and your favorite front-end framework (Vue, React, etc). 

You can use Vercel, Github pages, heroku, etc to host your DAPP for free. If you run into an error with Vercel when deploying [here's](https://dev.to/rabihcigar/treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true-22i4) the fix.

## Submission

* Email your Github link with your code and a link to your working front-end Dapp to [submit@cadena.dev]()  
* We will review your code which will count towards your certificaiton. 
* Plagiarism of any kind is not allowed and will disqualify you from receiving a certificate.
* Feel free to show off your project in the [#showcase](https://discord.gg/UQayXxzazc) channel in the discord and tweet about it. Be sure to tag [@cadenadev](https://twitter.com/cadenadev) for a retweet!
* We will reach back out once we review your project and if accept we will ask for your wallet address to send your NFT to.
