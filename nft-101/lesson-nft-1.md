# Project Walk Through 

In this course we will be learning creating our very own NFTs using generative art and create our own DAPP that allows others to mint our NFT. Our project will have 3 key parts and what's most cool about this project is you can use it for the basis to mint your nft projects without fear of being delisted by centralized marketplaces.

1. Generating our NFT Art Work
2. Creating an ERC721 Smart Contract for our NFTs
3. Creating a DAPP that allows others to mint our NFTs

Here's a [link](https://cadena-minter.vercel.app/) to what the final dapp will like and below you can find a screenshot.

## Prerequisites 
In order to complete this course, you will need to complete our [Ethereum 101](https://app.cadena.dev/course/ethereum-101/ZHjzLozd3mCsAcgMfeHE) course or have a foundational understanding of how to build dapps and smart contracts. 

## Technologies, Tools, and Libraries

We're going to use the following tools, technologies and libaries: 

1. Hardhat - To write, compile and deploy our smart contracts.
2. OpenZepplin - We will be using their ERC721 contract standards and libraries to speed up our development time.
3. POKT - For our node end point to send our contracts up to the Rinkeby testnets
4. MetaMask - Our wallet of choice to test our dapp.
5. Ether.js - We will use ethers library for the front-end of our dapp to interact with our smart contract. Our dapp will be built in React.
6. [WAGMI](https://wagmi.sh/) (optional) - A set of React Hooks that makes working with ethers more efficient. You can connect a wallet, display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, etc with a few lines of code.
7. Pinata - Will be used to host our files like our NFT images and metadata on the IPFS network. It's as easy to use as Dropbox.
8. HashLips - A library we will use create our generative art.

## Course Completion Requirements

You can earn a unique NFT Certificate for completing our NFT 101 course. To do so submit your own NFT Minter project completed with a dapp, smart contract, and your own unique NFT art work to team@cadena.dev with the name you would like on your certificate and your ethereum wallet address.

 ➡️ Now Let's get started with learning about what are NFTs in the next lesson!
