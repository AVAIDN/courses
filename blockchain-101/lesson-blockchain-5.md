# The Chain in Blockchain

The Chain in blockchain comes in because these blocks are cryptographically linked together with the hashes. The current block will have the hash of the previous block, and the next block will have the hash of the previous block and so on. If anything is changed on one block, the other blocks become invalidated. 

Now you may be wondering what generates the hashes for each block. This is done by a unique mathematical puzzle that each block needs to be solved to verify it is a real block. These puzzles get harder overtime and require immense computing power and for that power you are rewarded with some of the cryptocurrency of that blockchain. This is known as Proof of Work and has created the entire industry of mining which sooner or later will see itâ€™s last days as Proof of Stake is a more environmentally friendly approach.
