# The Network

Who manages and verifies the blockchain? If we had one major provider like say Amazon Web Services that wouldnâ€™t be so secure now would it? So the blockchain maintains a state of consensus by having an open network of nodes (think of it as a server for now), that anyone can join, and where everyone hosts a copy of the blockchain and verifies the blocks. Kind of like torrenting back in the old days. 

This adds an extra layer of security and prevents the double spend problem. It is important to know that it also creates immutability meaning once something is posted to the blockchain it cannot be undone.
